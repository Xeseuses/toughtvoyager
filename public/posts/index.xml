      <title>AnarcoPunk, A Vison For The Future</title>

      <description>In this post I want to introduce a new genre I dubbed AnarcoPunk. The punk genre is a collection of ideas that push against the mainstream narrative and propose different solutions and worlds that they deem the future. Sometimes those ideas are more utopian based than grounded in reality, but ala men are allowed to dream.&#xA;When searching the genre I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a good idea for an Anarchy themed punk.</description>

      <title>The Case For Anarchy</title>

      <description>In this post I want to defend the position for an anarchy based society. In my opinion is the concept of the state an relic from the past and do we need to go to another form of living. In my post [[The Failure Of Modern Day Democracy]] I already have argued I don´t believe in (modern day) democracy anymore. In this post I will lay out why no goverment/rule (anarchy) is the better option.</description>

      <description>In this post I want to explore the thought that modern day democracy has failed. I think modern day democracy doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a future. I will explain why and propose a new form of government that i think is the better option.&#xA;Why democracy doesn&amp;rsquo;t work in its current form Link to heading Most western countries have a democracy as government. The people choose who they want to represent them. This sounds good in practice, because if a lot of people vote who they want, the government will do anything that&amp;rsquo;s in the best interest of the people right?</description>

      <description>Mantra: Less, but better Mindset: It is about pausing constantly to ask: &amp;ldquo;Am I investing in the right activity?&amp;rdquo; Rejects: The idea we can fit all in To reach it: Distinguish the vital few from the trivial many, eliminate the non-essentials and then removing obstacles so the essential things have a clear, smooth passage&#xA;If you don&#39;t prioritize your life someone else will Why should we design our life? Because when we don&amp;rsquo;t purposefully and deliberately choose where to focus our energies and time, other people will choose for us, and before long we&amp;rsquo;ll have lose sight of everything that is meaningful and important</description>
