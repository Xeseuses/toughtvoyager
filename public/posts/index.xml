Sometimes, you may want to &lt;em>be seen&lt;/em> — to share stories, photos, ideas, or simply exist online without feeding corporate algorithms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s where the &lt;strong>Fediverse&lt;/strong> comes in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="-what-is-it">🌍 What is it?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Fediverse&lt;/strong> is a network of independently hosted platforms (like Mastodon, PeerTube, WriteFreely) that &lt;em>talk to each other&lt;/em>. You can join any server, follow people across servers, and post without needing Big Tech.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>⛩ The Inner Gate</title><link>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-inner-gate/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-inner-gate/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="how-we-keep-it-human">How We Keep It Human&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can’t stumble into this space.&lt;br>
That’s intentional.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There’s no sign-up page.&lt;br>
No “create an account.”&lt;br>
Instead, you’ll get something symbolic: &lt;strong>an Elder Key&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is your token.&lt;br>
Your pass.&lt;br>
Not just for access—but for &lt;em>intent&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This space works because we know who’s here.&lt;br>
We keep it small, kind, and warm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There’s light here. But it’s a fire we tend together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Next: [[🍃The Whisper Grove]]
Where the conversation flows. Private, soft-spoken, and human.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🍃The Whisper Grove</title><link>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-whisper-grove/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-whisper-grove/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="where-we-actually-talk">Where We Actually Talk&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This isn’t a forum.&lt;br>
It’s not a feed.&lt;br>
It’s not WhatsApp.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s quieter. More human.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We use a system called &lt;strong>Nostr&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
It lets us chat, share notes, and even do calls in a space &lt;em>we&lt;/em> control.&lt;br>
You’ll pick a key. Join a private relay. And connect directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It sounds complex. But I’ll help you.&lt;br>
And once it’s set up, it’s just… peaceful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like a campfire for kindred minds.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🏡 The Shelter of Haven</title><link>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-shelter-of-haven/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-shelter-of-haven/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-safe-space-beyond-the-algorithm">A Safe Space, Beyond the Algorithm&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Imagine a quiet corner of the internet.&lt;br>
No ads. No feeds. No strangers watching.&lt;br>
Only people you trust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s what &lt;em>Haven&lt;/em> is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s built on something called &lt;strong>Yggdrasil&lt;/strong> — a kind of hidden internet.&lt;br>
No one knows you’re there unless you invite them.&lt;br>
And even then, it’s quiet by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where we talk.&lt;br>
This is where we gather.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You don’t need to install anything right now.&lt;br>
But if you want to join us later, I’ll show you how.&lt;br>
Step by step.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🏮The Lantern at the Edge</title><link>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-lantern-at-the-edge/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-lantern-at-the-edge/</guid><description>&lt;p>🏮 &lt;strong>The Lantern at the Edge&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
🔥 Welcome, wanderer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You’ve found the lantern at the edge —&lt;br>
where the noisy, crowded internet fades,&lt;br>
and a quieter, human-scaled world begins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No endless feeds. No followers to tally.&lt;br>
No surveillance watching every move.&lt;br>
Just trails chosen by you, not pushed on you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’ve ever felt watched&amp;hellip;&lt;br>
If you’ve longed to step away from the algorithm&amp;hellip;&lt;br>
If you crave a slower, quieter digital life&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🕯 Awakening</title><link>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/awakening/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/awakening/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="our-online-life-is-changing">Our online life is changing&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We are more and more spending time online. We hasn&amp;rsquo;t a phone and a laptop and more devices these days? And there is so much to offer. But life online has changed. There is more noise. Less peace. More control. Less trust. Fewer real moments&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And there is more about your devices than being a simple digital tool:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Your phone seems to know what you said aloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ads follow you like shadows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every app wants your email, your birthday, your face.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These devices give us so much for so less hassle. But we trade our convenience for something else, but no one tells us what. And somewhere, inside all this scrolling, t starts to feel like we’re being watched.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🗺The Seed Kit</title><link>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-seed-kit/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-seed-kit/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-starter-pack-for-going-deeper">A Starter Pack for Going Deeper&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some of you will want to go further.&lt;br>
Set up your own space. Join other gardens.&lt;br>
Maybe help someone else along the path.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This kit gives you tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A USB stick or download pack&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A printable zine&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A list of beginner tools&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A guide to inviting others&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A “start here” for growing your own private garden&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You can use it now. Or later.&lt;br>
But it’ll be here when you’re ready.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🛠 The Path of Disconnection</title><link>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-path-of-disconnection/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-path-of-disconnection/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="-you-dont-need-to-throw-away-your-phone">🌿 You Don’t Need to Throw Away Your Phone&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This isn’t about becoming a hermit.&lt;br>
It’s about becoming a human again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Disconnection doesn’t mean isolation.&lt;br>
It means turning off the noise long enough to hear your own thoughts.&lt;br>
It means stepping outside the system — not forever, but long enough to remember that you can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And once you do, you might not want to go back.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You’re not leaving the internet.&lt;br>
You’re stepping into a smaller one. A human one.&lt;br>
Built with care.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You don’t need to know code.&lt;br>
You don’t need to prove anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You just need to value something more than likes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This trail isn’t about escape.&lt;br>
It’s about &lt;em>returning&lt;/em> — to dignity, to agency, to truth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If any part of you is still listening…&lt;br>
Come further.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="explanation-in-short">Explanation in short&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The future will be decentralized and sustainable where voluntary cooperation, market innovation and strong property rights foster community resilience without the need for (a) centralized authority.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Private Cities, the better alternative to countries</title><link>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/private-cities-the-better-alternative-to-countries/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/private-cities-the-better-alternative-to-countries/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this post will I explain what living in free private cities is like.

&lt;p>Imagine a system in which a private company as a &amp;ldquo;government service provider&amp;rdquo; offers you protection of life, liberty and property? You would pay a contractually fixed amount for these services. And the contract can not be changed unilaterally. Disputes would be decided by independent arbitration tribunals. If the operator ignores arbitral awards or abuses their power, customers would leave and the would go bankrupt. Only by treating their customers well will they retain business.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Case For Anarchy</title><link>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-case-for-anarchy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-case-for-anarchy/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this post I want to defend the position for an anarchy based society. In my opinion is the concept of the state an relic from the past and do we need to go to another form of living. In my post [[The Failure of Modern Day Democracy]]
I already have argued I don´t believe in (modern day) democracy anymore. In this post I will lay out why no goverment/rule (anarchy) is the better option.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Failure Of Modern Day Democracy</title><link>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-failure-of-modern-day-democracy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-failure-of-modern-day-democracy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Democracy, the pinnacle of governance. People choose their leaders, ensure freedom, fairness and accountability. What&amp;rsquo;s not to like about that? Well, how about reality? In practice, modern democracy has devolved into a dysfunctional, corrupt and inefficient system that servers the political elites and special interests rather than the people. Elections are manipulated by lobbyists, majoritarian rule crushes minority rights, and bureaucracies expand unchecked, eroding personal freedom under the guise of &amp;ldquo;public good.&amp;rdquo; Worse, democracy incentivizes short-term thinking, economic mismanagement, and populist policies that ultimately weaken societies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Way of the Essentialist</title><link>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-way-of-the-essentialist/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-way-of-the-essentialist/</guid><description>&lt;p>Mantra: Less, but better
Mindset: It is about pausing constantly to ask: &amp;ldquo;Am I investing in the right activity?&amp;rdquo;
Rejects: The idea we can fit all in
To reach it: Distinguish the vital few from the trivial many, eliminate the non-essentials and then removing obstacles so the essential things have a clear, smooth passage&lt;/p>

your life
someone else will

&lt;p>Why should we design our life?
Because when we don&amp;rsquo;t purposefully and deliberately choose where to focus our energies and time, other people will choose for us, and before long we&amp;rsquo;ll have lose sight of everything that is meaningful and important&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
