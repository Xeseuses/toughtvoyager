<p>Most western countries have a democracy as government. The people choose who they want to represent them. This sounds good in practice, because if a lot of people vote who they want, the government will do anything that&rsquo;s in the best interest of the people right? Not necessarily. In most countries there is a multi party government that has to make concessions in order to be able to govern. That means parties have to sacrifice points they where campaigning on in order to be able to govern in the first place. And not even that, the biggest party doesn&rsquo;t necessarily always the biggest group in the country, look at the system in Britain for example where the biggest party (412 seats) only had almost 2 million votes more than the second biggest party which only has 121 seats. So only about 2 million votes more resulted in a whopping 291 more seats in the parliament. [1]</p>
<p>And then I haven&rsquo;t even spoken about the people who voted an different party which doesn&rsquo;t get seated in the government. These people won&rsquo;t have a representation of their voice for the next few years until they have another shot a trying to get their voice heard.</p>
<p>Besides the countries with the highest trust in the government aren&rsquo;t considered democracies [2];</p>
<ol>
<li>Saudi Arabia (absolute monarchy): 86%</li>
<li>China (people&rsquo;s republic): 85%</li>
<li>UAE (federation): 84%</li>
</ol>
<p>Also there is the problem of lobbyists and an uninvolved and often uninformed electorate.</p>
<p>Then we haven&rsquo;t not even spoken about government meddling in people&rsquo;s domains of lives where they have nothing to say in, but will do anyway&rsquo;s because they think it is in the best interest. Those interests they think are good, are often times controlled by big farma and big food. See the covid 19 pandamic in which most governments around the world participated in a form of authoritarianism in the name of pseudo-science. Mind you that many of the proposed actions weren&rsquo;t  thoroughly based in science at all.</p>

<p>Personally I think a form as Minarchy, based on the principles of Libertarianism, is a better form of government. Here is why in a nutshell:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduces Overreach</li>
<li>Increases Efficiency:</li>
<li>Promotes Individual Freedom:</li>
<li>Reduces Corruption:</li>
<li>Represents Diverse Perspectives:</li>
<li>Prevents Populism:</li>
<li>Focuses on Governance:</li>
<li>Avoids Majority Tyranny:</li>
<li>Encourages Innovation:</li>
<li>Respects Personal Autonomy:</li>
</ol>
<p>And will explain it in more detail:</p>

<p>Goverment has a powerful postition in which they are able to overpower anyone. We have given them this power, but are we sure they don&rsquo;t use it against their citizens in a wrong way? Goverments are able to take everything from a person if they don&rsquo;t like it. See the freezing of the bankaccounts from the Freedom Truckers in Canada [3] or the hunt on a Dutch covid protest organizer [4].</p>
<p>Why would we give the goverment that power and allow them to hunt down any person they deem to be wrong, even if it is only because the goverment finds it correct to do. What&rsquo;s is the difference between that and for example the maffia, other than that we give the goverment that power (somewhat) voluntarily</p>
