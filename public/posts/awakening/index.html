Can we do something about it?\nWhat’s Actually Happening Instead of simply browsing online, your every moment is tracked:\n🧠 Every click, pause, or scroll feeds invisible algorithms. Websites and apps track what you click, read, search, and say. They build detailed psychological profiles to predict (and shape) what you’ll do next. 🎯 Algorithms decide what you see — not to inform, but to keep you scrolling, buying, fearing, or reacting. [[🔍“Algorithms Aren’t Neutral”]] 👁 Big platforms track where you go, what you buy, what you feel. 🔍 Advertisers know more about you than most friends. 🧬 Data brokers sell profiles that include your mental health, income, and location history. Your face, fingerprints, and voice are increasingly used to log you in and log things about you without consent. Your phone, smart home, fitness tracker, ID — all these data streams are merged by governments and corporations into vast dossiers. I go deeper into this, in this post: [[📸“What They Know About You”]] And this is not just some rumors. It is said by British mathematician Clive Humby: Data is the new gold .1 And that’s not all:\nNew laws (like the Digital Services Act in the EU) will soon pressure platforms to monitor everything you post automatically, and silently. And governments can now force platforms to censor, track, and report you. 2 3 Palantir and similar firms work with states to centralize personal, financial, social, and even emotional data into predictive systems. And as said: Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are coming — allowing financial surveillance and control at the transaction level. 4 📦 You are not the customer. You are the product. And we pay with [[🛑“What If I Don’t Want to Be a Product?”]]: Our attention: turned into a product, sold to the highest Our relationships: nudged by invisible algorithms.

But here’s the good news:\nYou don’t have to live that way.\nThere are trails away from the noise.\nPaths built by people—not platforms.\nSmall, quiet, beautiful places.\nThis is the beginning of one.\n**Next: [[🛠 The Path of Disconnection]] A look at how to gently start loosening the hooks of the system.\nFurther reading\n[[📸“What They Know About You”]]\nReal-world examples of surveillance (Google location history, Facebook profiles, data leaks)\n[[🔍“Algorithms Aren’t Neutral”]]\nA short story-style breakdown of filter bubbles and nudging\n[[🛑“What If I Don’t Want to Be a Product?”]]\nEmotional case for reclaiming agency without sounding paranoid\nhttps://medium.com/@SoteraHeritage/data-is-gold-not-oil-168f5c26c267 ↩︎\nhttps://decisionmagazine.com/experts-discuss-dangers-of-european-online-censorship-law-a/ ↩︎\nhttps://www.iiea.com/publications/the-digital-services-act-censorship-risks-for-europe ↩︎\nhttps://thenationaltelegraph.com/bitcoin-finance/why-central-bank-digital-currencies-cbdcs-are-so-dangerous/ ↩︎\n","wordCount":"563","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-06-07T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-06-09T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/awakening/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://thoughtvoyager.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://thoughtvoyager.com/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=http://thoughtvoyager.com/articles/ title=Articles><span>Articles</span></a></li><li><a href=http://thoughtvoyager.com/trails/ title=Trails><span>Trails</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><main style="padding:2rem;max-width:850px;margin:auto;font-family:segoe ui,sans-serif;background:#fffdf7"><style>.note-title{font-size:2.25rem;font-weight:700;color:#2e4d3a;margin-bottom:.75rem}.post-meta{font-size:.9rem;color:#777;margin-bottom:2rem}.content p{margin-top:1.5rem;line-height:1.8}.content h1,.content h2,.content h3,.content h4{margin-top:3rem;margin-bottom:1.5rem;line-height:1.3}.content a[href^="/"]{color:#3b7a57;text-decoration:underline dotted;transition:color .2s}.content a[href^="/"]:hover{color:#2e4d3a}.content ul{padding-left:2.5rem;margin-top:1rem;margin-bottom:1rem}.content ul ul{padding-left:2rem}.content ol{padding-left:2.5rem;margin-top:1rem;margin-bottom:1rem}.related{background:#f4f8f5;padding:1.5rem;border-radius:12px;margin-top:3rem;border-left:5px solid #cfe3d8}.related h3{margin-top:0;margin-bottom:1rem;color:#3b7a57}.related ul{list-style-type:disc;padding-left:2.5rem}.related a{text-decoration:none;color:#2f5c45}.related a:hover{text-decoration:underline}</style><h1 class=note-title>🕯 Awakening</h1><p class=post-meta>🗓️ Published: Jun 7, 2025<br>🛠️ Last edited: Jun 9, 2025</p><div class=content><h3 id=our-online-life-is-changing>Our online life is changing&mldr;</h3><p>We are more and more spending time online.
