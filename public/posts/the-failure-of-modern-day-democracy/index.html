Elections are manipulated by lobbyists, majoritarian rule crushes minority rights, and bureaucracies expand unchecked, eroding personal freedom under the guise of “public good.” Worse, democracy incentivizes short-term thinking, economic mismanagement, and populist policies that ultimately weaken societies.\nIf democracy is the end all, be all system, then why feel voters betrayed, do elections feel meaningless and individual rights secondary to political power? Why are the so many people poor, sick, homeless, etc.? Why does the US topple democracies and install leaders that have goodwill towards them? Why are some democracies short lived, only for one party to decide to step out of the coalition and send the country in more uncertainty? 1\nThe truth is, democracy has failed. It’s time to explore a better alternative: a system that prioritizes liberty, accountability, and real governance over the illusion of choice\nWhy democracy doesn’t work in its current form Short Overview Okay so I’ve made my case in short in the introduction about why I think democracy has failed. But maybe you have questions or think: surely it is not that bad? Well I want to delve deeper into seven points in which i will lay out my case. Then i propose the solution for what I think is the better way. Throughout reading this you may think: I disagree with all of that, and that’s fine. I am not here to convince you about my point, only to make you think. But maybe you think: hmm, I never thought about that, maybe I need to delve deeper in these concepts. Great! I will give some references I which you can delve deeper and you can also explore other posts in my digital garden for posts about or other things\nVoter Incentives \u0026 Rational ignorance: Most voters don’t have strong incentives to be well-informed Short-Term Thinking - Politicians prioritize election cycles over long-term policy planning, leading to unsustainable debt, economic mismanagement, and reactionary governance. Mob Rule \u0026 The Tyranny of the Majority: Democracy often results in one group imposing its will on others rather than protecting individual rights. Crony Capitalism \u0026 Regulatory Capture The fusion of government and corporate interests leads to policies favoring established elites instead of a free market. Government Monopoly on Power Unlike businesses, governments in democracies don’t face competition, reducing accountability an innovation Failure of Checks \u0026 Balances Even in representative systems, bureaucracies operate with little accountability, leading to inefficient and sometimes outright harmful policies. Democratic Erosion- Many democracies devolve into authoritarianism, as seen with increased surveillance, censorship, and suppression of dissent. Voter Incentives \u0026 Rational ignorance Short-Term Thinking A study of the Utrecht University found that politicians are experiencing an increase in short-termism in Dutch politics, at the expense of essential longer-term planning 2\nMob Rule \u0026 The Tyranny of the Majority: For this point I want to draw on the thoughts of Alexis de Tocqueville’s book: Democracy in America. 3 In this book Alexis provides an in-depth analysis of the potential danger of a majority rule and its impact on individual rights\nCrony Capitalism \u0026 Regulatory Capture Government Monopoly on Power Failure of Checks \u0026 Balances Democratic Erosion Another way of governing Personally I think a form as Minarchy, based on the principles of Libertarianism, is a better form of government. Here is why in a nutshell:\nReduces Overreach - a minimal state ensures that laws only protect life, liberty and property rather than controlling personal choices Increases Efficiency - With fewer bureaucratic layers, resources are allocated more effectively, reducing waste and stagnation Promotes Individual Freedom - Less government interference means more room for voluntary cooperation, entrepreneurship, and personal choice. Reduces Corruption -Fewer regulatory powers mean fewer opportunities for bribery and corporate lobbying. Represents Diverse Perspectives - Decentralization allows for voluntary communities and governance structures that better match people’s values. Prevents Populism - Without a large state apparatus, political leaders have less power to exploit popular fears and emotions. Focuses on Governance - Instead of endless political struggles, governance is limited to enforcing contracts, protecting rights, and national defense. Avoids Majority Tyranny - By protecting individual rights instead of majority rule, minarchy prevents systemic oppression of minority groups. Encourages Innovation - Less regulation fosters economic and technological progress by allowing competition and experimentation. Respects Personal Autonomy - Individuals can live as they choose without being forced into a one-size-fits-all political system. And will explain it in more detail:\nReduces Overreach Increases Efficiency Promotes Individual Freedom Reduces Corruption Represents Diverse Perspectives Prevents Populism Focuses on Governance Avoids Majority Tyranny Encourages Innovation Respects Personal Autonomy Links:\nhttps://nos.nl/collectie/13996/artikel/2569767-wilders-breekt-met-coalitie-trekt-pvv-ers-terug-uit-kabinet-schoof ↩︎\nhttps://www.uu.nl/en/news/short-term-thinking-in-dutch-politics-comes-at-the-expense-of-the-longer-term?utm_source=chatgpt.com ↩︎\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/815/815-h/815-h.htm ↩︎\n","wordCount":"810","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-12-11T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-06-04T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-failure-of-modern-day-democracy/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://thoughtvoyager.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://thoughtvoyager.com/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=http://thoughtvoyager.com/articles/ title=Articles><span>Articles</span></a></li><li><a href=http://thoughtvoyager.com/trails/ title=Trails><span>Trails</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><main style="padding:2rem;max-width:850px;margin:auto;font-family:segoe ui,sans-serif;background:#fffdf7"><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){main{background:#121212;color:#ddd}.note-title{color:#a8d5a3}.post-meta{color:#aaa}.content a[href^="/"]{color:#7fc77f}.content a[href^="/"]:hover{color:#a8d5a3}.related{background:#1e1e1e;border-left:5px solid #3a663a}.related h3{color:#7fc77f}.related a{color:#a8d5a3}.related a:hover{text-decoration:underline}}</style><h1 class=note-title>The Failure Of Modern Day Democracy</h1><p class=post-meta>🗓️ Published: Dec 11, 2024<br>🛠️ Last edited: Jun 4, 2025</p><div class=content><p>Democracy, the pinnacle of governance.
