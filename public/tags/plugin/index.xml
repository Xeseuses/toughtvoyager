      <description>Principles Link to heading Adds badges to links to show how many times it is linked Hovering over it will show all backlinks Clicking on it will open it in a new pane Unlike the traditional backlinks pane which shows backlinks based on the note you are on, this pane will stay until you click onto another Strange New Worlds badge Includes the context of the link (children tags, the header it is in, etc) If a note in your header has a link to it, it will show beside the header ðŸ¤¯ Check the header above and beside the link itself after linking it [[Obsidian Strange New Worlds Plugin#Principles]] Uses Link to heading With the ability to link to headers, you can use it to collect sections of a note For example, when I take notes on a conversation in [[Daily Template#Conversations]], at the top of the conversation I can make a link to [[Person Template#Conversations]] so if I visit that header and hover over the badge I can see all the conversations I had with that person.</description>

      <description>Principles Link to heading A centralized command palette for custom workflows Tons of customizability, especially if you inject your own scripts, so let your imagination run wild ðŸ˜Ž I just mainly use it to organize the different templates and use cases of the vault, like creating the different relevant notes Each command you see in the QuickAdd command pallete (Ctrl+Shift+P) are called choices I think you need to disable and enable the command palette action (click lightning bolt twice) to make changes effective, or else embedded buttons won&amp;rsquo;t work Palette Link to heading To access all choices you have, you can run:</description>

      <description>[!WARNING] Setup Required I disabled the plugin in the vault for now, if you want to use it just enable it in the settings&#xA;[!TIP] Video Example How it works Link to heading First, the notes in your vault get broken up into different blocks based on its headings. Next, to determine the relevance of each block, each one is sent to OpenAI, which generates an embedding for that particular block, a set of values that describe its characteristics across different dimensions.</description>

      <description>[!WARNING] Title If you are using a previous version of the vault, you can remove the existing emojis with Bulk Rename Plugin.&#xA;I added this plugin so I could get rid of the emoji prefixes inside the note titles because:&#xA;they would sometimes change to be the same emoji but be technically different, so previously existing links to them would be removed be corrupted upon unzipping and opening a vault make obsidian publish links bloated because of having to URL encode any emojis So, with this plugin, you can now still see the prefixes to identify text, but it won&amp;rsquo;t be an actual part of the title!</description>

      <description>Whether you&amp;rsquo;re wanting to save money from a monthly subscription or want all your digital stuff in one place, I hope the implementation of this plugin can be helpful for you :)&#xA;Just like how [[Dataview Plugin]] turns your notes into a searchable database, you can search through all your notes to find and organize the different types of tasks in your vault.&#xA;If you want, you can consider combining it with the [[Kanban Plugin]] for a more visual layout.</description>
