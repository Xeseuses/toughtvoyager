Can we do something about it?\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Actually Happening Instead of simply browsing online, your every moment is tracked:\n🧠 Every click, pause, or scroll feeds invisible algorithms. Websites and apps track what you click, read, search, and say. They build detailed psychological profiles to predict (and shape) what you’ll do next. 🎯 Algorithms decide what you see — not to inform, but to keep you scrolling, buying, fearing, or reacting. [[🔍“Algorithms Aren’t Neutral”]] 👁 Big platforms track where you go, what you buy, what you feel. 🔍 Advertisers know more about you than most friends. 🧬 Data brokers sell profiles that include your mental health, income, and location history. Your face, fingerprints, and voice are increasingly used to log you in and log things about you without consent. Your phone, smart home, fitness tracker, ID — all these data streams are merged by governments and corporations into vast dossiers. I go deeper into this, in this post: [[📸“What They Know About You”]] And this is not just some rumors. It is said by British mathematician Clive Humby: Data is the new gold .1 And that\u0026rsquo;s not all:\nNew laws (like the Digital Services Act in the EU) will soon pressure platforms to monitor everything you post automatically, and silently. And governments can now force platforms to censor, track, and report you. 2 3 Palantir and similar firms work with states to centralize personal, financial, social, and even emotional data into predictive systems. And as said: Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are coming — allowing financial surveillance and control at the transaction level. 4 📦 You are not the customer. You are the product.

Let’s gently peel back the layers of the devices we carry everywhere. They do more than it seems on the surface:\nYour phone constantly shares your location, even when it says it doesn’t. Your apps often talk to dozens of hidden servers — tracking you, profiling you. Your camera, mic, and keyboard can be accessed remotely in some cases — by companies or governments. Your cloud storage isn’t really yours. Your search history, even in “private” mode, is recorded and cross-linked. Even turning it off doesn’t guarantee silence.\nBut you’re not helpless.

Voluntary Order – Private arbitration, competing security firms, and social contracts replace state-enforced laws. Decentralization In my post [[The Failure of Modern Day Democracy]] I already proposed the idea of Minarchy as a way of governance instead of other now mainstream ideas as democracy, monarchy, republics, etc. In short: Minarchy revers to a state which is limited and minimal, whose functions are reduces to the enforcer of the non-aggression principle by providing military, police and courts. Because why would we allow a group of people to decide what is good for us when we oftentimes don\u0026rsquo;t even choose them, or for other reasons then what they end up enforcing.\nIn the future the idea of a country will be outdated. Instead we will live in private cities, see: [[Private Cities, the better alternative to countries]]. Because today\u0026rsquo;s political systems provide incentives for those in power to enrich themselves and their supporters at the expense of society.\nSelf-Sovereignty In his book The Law, Frédéric Bastiat argues that individuality, liberty and property are man and three gifts from God. 1 Thus every person has a natural right to defend his person, his liberty and his property. These are the three basic requirements of life, and the preservation of any one of them is completely dependent upon the preservation of the other two.\nhttp://bastiat.org/en/the_law.html\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/a-manifesto-for-the-future/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAll good and well do you maybe think at this point after reading some of my ideas, but what is the way forward then?

In practice, modern democracy has devolved into a dysfunctional, corrupt and inefficient system that servers the political elites and special interests rather than the people. Elections are manipulated by lobbyists, majoritarian rule crushes minority rights, and bureaucracies expand unchecked, eroding personal freedom under the guise of \u0026ldquo;public good.\u0026rdquo; Worse, democracy incentivizes short-term thinking, economic mismanagement, and populist policies that ultimately weaken societies.\nIf democracy is the end all, be all system, then why feel voters betrayed, do elections feel meaningless and individual rights secondary to political power?

It\u0026rsquo;s time to explore a better alternative: a system that prioritizes liberty, accountability, and real governance over the illusion of choice\nWhy democracy doesn\u0026rsquo;t work in its current form Short Overview Okay so I\u0026rsquo;ve made my case in short in the introduction about why I think democracy has failed. But maybe you have questions or think: surely it is not that bad? Well I want to delve deeper into seven points in which i will lay out my case. Then i propose the solution for what I think is the better way. Throughout reading this you may think: I disagree with all of that, and that\u0026rsquo;s fine. I am not here to convince you about my point, only to make you think. But maybe you think: hmm, I never thought about that, maybe I need to delve deeper in these concepts. Great! I will give some references I which you can delve deeper and you can also explore other posts in my digital garden for posts about or other things\nVoter Incentives \u0026amp; Rational ignorance: Most voters don\u0026rsquo;t have strong incentives to be well-informed Short-Term Thinking - Politicians prioritize election cycles over long-term policy planning, leading to unsustainable debt, economic mismanagement, and reactionary governance. Mob Rule \u0026amp; The Tyranny of the Majority: Democracy often results in one group imposing its will on others rather than protecting individual rights. Crony Capitalism \u0026amp; Regulatory Capture The fusion of government and corporate interests leads to policies favoring established elites instead of a free market. Government Monopoly on Power Unlike businesses, governments in democracies don’t face competition, reducing accountability an innovation Failure of Checks \u0026amp; Balances Even in representative systems, bureaucracies operate with little accountability, leading to inefficient and sometimes outright harmful policies. Democratic Erosion- Many democracies devolve into authoritarianism, as seen with increased surveillance, censorship, and suppression of dissent. Voter Incentives \u0026amp; Rational ignorance Short-Term Thinking A study of the Utrecht University found that politicians are experiencing an increase in short-termism in Dutch politics, at the expense of essential longer-term planning 2\nMob Rule \u0026amp; The Tyranny of the Majority: For this point I want to draw on the thoughts of Alexis de Tocqueville\u0026rsquo;s book: Democracy in America. 3 In this book Alexis provides an in-depth analysis of the potential danger of a majority rule and its impact on individual rights\nCrony Capitalism \u0026amp; Regulatory Capture Government Monopoly on Power Failure of Checks \u0026amp; Balances Democratic Erosion Another way of governing Personally I think a form as Minarchy, based on the principles of Libertarianism, is a better form of government. Here is why in a nutshell:\nReduces Overreach - a minimal state ensures that laws only protect life, liberty and property rather than controlling personal choices Increases Efficiency - With fewer bureaucratic layers, resources are allocated more effectively, reducing waste and stagnation Promotes Individual Freedom - Less government interference means more room for voluntary cooperation, entrepreneurship, and personal choice. Reduces Corruption -Fewer regulatory powers mean fewer opportunities for bribery and corporate lobbying. Represents Diverse Perspectives - Decentralization allows for voluntary communities and governance structures that better match people’s values. Prevents Populism - Without a large state apparatus, political leaders have less power to exploit popular fears and emotions. Focuses on Governance - Instead of endless political struggles, governance is limited to enforcing contracts, protecting rights, and national defense. Avoids Majority Tyranny - By protecting individual rights instead of majority rule, minarchy prevents systemic oppression of minority groups. Encourages Innovation - Less regulation fosters economic and technological progress by allowing competition and experimentation. Respects Personal Autonomy - Individuals can live as they choose without being forced into a one-size-fits-all political system. And will explain it in more detail:\nReduces Overreach Increases Efficiency Promotes Individual Freedom Reduces Corruption Represents Diverse Perspectives Prevents Populism Focuses on Governance Avoids Majority Tyranny Encourages Innovation Respects Personal Autonomy Links:\nhttps://nos.nl/collectie/13996/artikel/2569767-wilders-breekt-met-coalitie-trekt-pvv-ers-terug-uit-kabinet-schoof\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.uu.nl/en/news/short-term-thinking-in-dutch-politics-comes-at-the-expense-of-the-longer-term?utm_source=chatgpt.com\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/815/815-h/815-h.htm\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"http://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-failure-of-modern-day-democracy/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDemocracy, the pinnacle of governance.

Imagination is the source of every form of human achievement. Play, which I would define as anything we do simply for the joy of doing, rather than means to an end. Nothing fires up the brain like play.\nWhy? Because:\nPlat broadens the range of options available to us Play is an antidote to stress Play has a positive effect on the executive function of the brain Sleep After sleep when we wake up, our brains may have make new neural connections, thereby opening up a broader range of solutions to problems, literally overnight\nSelect To become more selective in the choices we make, the key is to put the decision to an extreme test: if we feel total and utter conviction to do something, then we say yes.\nUse the 90% rule. As you evaluate an option, give the option a score between 0 and 100. If you rate it any lower than 90, change the rating to 0 and simply reject it.\nThe point is that the very act of applying selective criteria forces you to choose which perfect option to wait for.\nIf we say yes because it is an easy reward, we run the risk of having later to say no to a more meaningful one.\nHow to make a selection?\nWrite down the opportunity Write down a list of three minimum criteria Write down a list of three extreme criteria Check if it passes the first set of criteria If yes, check if it passes two of the extreme critera 4 and 5 yes?
