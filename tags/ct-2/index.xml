&lt;p>We are more and more spending time online. We hasn&amp;rsquo;t a phone and a laptop and more devices these days? And there is so much to offer. But life online has changed. There is more noise. Less peace. More control. Less trust. Fewer real moments&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And there is more about your devices than being a simple digital tool:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Disconnection doesn’t mean isolation.&lt;br>
It means turning off the noise long enough to hear your own thoughts.&lt;br>
It means stepping outside the system — not forever, but long enough to remember that you can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And once you do, you might not want to go back.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Let’s gently peel back the layers of the devices we carry everywhere:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
