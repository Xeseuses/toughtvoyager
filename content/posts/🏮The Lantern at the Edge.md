🏮 **The Lantern at the Edge**  
🔥 Welcome, wanderer.

You’ve found the lantern at the edge —  
where the noisy, crowded internet fades,  
and a quieter, human-scaled world begins.

No endless feeds. No followers to tally.  
No surveillance watching every move.  
Just trails chosen by you, not pushed on you.

If you’ve ever felt watched...  
If you’ve longed to step away from the algorithm...  
If you crave a slower, quieter digital life...

This is your map.

## 🚶 The Trail Ahead

Each page is a step. Pause or proceed as you wish.  
But if something stirs inside you...  
keep walking.--

Some places here need a special token — an **Elder Key**.  
It’s more than a password. It’s an invitation, a sign of trust and intent.  
You’ll know when it’s time to receive yours.
