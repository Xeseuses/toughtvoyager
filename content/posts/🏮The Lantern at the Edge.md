🔥 **Welcome, wanderer.**

You’ve found the lantern at the edge.

This is where the old internet ends —  
and a different one begins.

No timelines. No feeds. No followers.  
No surveillance. No noise.  
Just trails.  
Chosen, not pushed.

If you’ve ever felt like you’re _being watched_…  
If you’ve ever wanted to leave the algorithm…  
If you’ve longed for a slower, quieter digital life…

This is your map.

## 🧭 What is This?

**The Lantern at the Edge** is a gentle guide into a hidden, human-scaled part of the internet.

Built for people who want:  
✅ More privacy  
✅ More trust  
✅ Less noise  
✅ Less extraction

You won’t need a tech background. You won’t need a server.  
Just a desire to reclaim a little bit of your digital life.

Some pages or spaces require a token: an **Elder Key**.  
This is how we keep things small, intentional, and beautiful.

You’ll know when the moment comes.
