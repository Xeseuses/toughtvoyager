Title: A Manifesto For The Future
date: 2025-02-07
---
All good and well do you maybe think at this point after reading some of my ideas, but what is the way forward then? In this post I want to give a short manifesto for how I imagine the future to be.

## Explanation in short

The future will be decentralized and sustainable where voluntary cooperation, market innovation and strong property rights foster community resilience without the need for (a) centralized authority.

## Philosophy & Core Values 
1. **Decentralization** - No central authority; cities; markets, and even laws emerge through voluntary association
2. **Hyper-Entrepreneurialism** - Everything is privately funded and open-source, leading to a culture of innovation and competition
3. **Self-Sovereignty** - People own their bodies, data, and property.
4. **Voluntary Order** – Private arbitration, competing security firms, and social contracts replace state-enforced laws.

## Decentralization
In my post [The Failure of Modern Day Democracy](https://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/the-failure-of-modern-day-democracy/) I already proposed the idea of Minarchy as a way of governance instead of other now mainstream ideas as democracy, monarchy, republics, etc. In short: Minarchy revers to a state which is limited and minimal, whose functions are reduces to the enforcer of the non-aggression principle by providing military, police and courts. Because why would we allow a group of people to decide what is good for us when we oftentimes don't even choose them, or for other reasons then what they end up enforcing. 

In the future the idea of a country will be outdated. Instead we will live in private cities, see: [Private Cities, the better alternative to country's](https://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/private-cities,-the-better-alternative-to-country's/). Because today's political systems provide incentives for those in power to enrich themselves and their supporters at the expense of society.

## Self-Sovereignty

In his book The Law, Frédéric Bastiat argues that individuality, liberty and property are man and three gifts from God [^1]
