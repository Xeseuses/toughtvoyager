### Where We Actually Talk

This isn’t a forum.  
It’s not a feed.  
It’s not WhatsApp.

It’s quieter. More human.

We use a system called **Nostr**.  
It lets us chat, share notes, and even do calls in a space _we_ control.  
You’ll pick a key. Join a private relay. And connect directly.

It sounds complex. But I’ll help you.  
And once it’s set up, it’s just… peaceful.

Like a campfire for kindred minds.
