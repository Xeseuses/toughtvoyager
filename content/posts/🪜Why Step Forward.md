### The World We Build Is Ours

You’re not leaving the internet.  
You’re stepping into a smaller one. A human one.  
Built with care.

You don’t need to know code.  
You don’t need to prove anything.

You just need to value something more than likes.

This trail isn’t about escape.  
It’s about _returning_ — to dignity, to agency, to truth.

If any part of you is still listening…  
Come further.
