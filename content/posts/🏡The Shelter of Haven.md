### A Safe Space, Beyond the Algorithm

Imagine a quiet corner of the internet.  
No ads. No feeds. No strangers watching.  
Only people you trust.

That’s what _Haven_ is.

It’s built on something called **Yggdrasil** — a kind of hidden internet.  
No one knows you’re there unless you invite them.  
And even then, it’s quiet by default.

This is where we talk.  
This is where we gather.

You don’t need to install anything right now.  
But if you want to join us later, I’ll show you how.  
Step by step.

**Next: [[⛩ The Inner Gate]]
A gentle way to verify you're a real person, not a bot, and walk further into the trail.
