## Summary

Keep a workprogress log, feed the machine, make an event of your worst tasks, build a routine
## Notes

Tip #1

Keep a workprogress log. Write down tasks and workblocks. Write down blocks and add a objective to it, when done mak it off. 

Tip #2

Feed the machine: drink water continually. Monitor cafeÃ¯ne intake. Check what you eat: glucose spike (!), skip breakfast: intermitting fasting

Tip #3

Make an event of your worst tasks. Tell people about it, go to a place to work on those tasks etc. Don't make it bigger than it is, it will put you off! 

Tip #4

Build a routine. Bests results are in the morning, how later on the day how harder it becomes. Block of times to do the same things everytime -> makes it a routine. 

Tip #5

Choose your hard days. These days you have to do very hard days: starting a paper, long study sessions, etc.
