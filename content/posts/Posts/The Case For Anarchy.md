Title: The Case For Anarchy
date: 2025-02-03
---
In this post I want to defend the position for an anarchy based society. In my opinion is the concept of the state an relic from the past and do we need to go to another form of living. In my post [The Failure Of Modern Day Democracy](https://thoughtvoyager.com/posts/posts/the-failure-of-modern-day-democracy/)
I already have argued I donÂ´t believe in (modern day) democracy anymore. In this post I will lay out why no goverment/rule (anarchy) is the better option.
## Definition:

A political philosophy and practice that opposses ALL hierachies along with their justifying dogmas and proposes the unending pursuit of anarchy, where free association, self-determination and mutal aid form the basis of our society.
