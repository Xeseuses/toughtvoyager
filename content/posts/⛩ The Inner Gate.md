### How We Keep It Human

You can’t stumble into this space.  
That’s intentional.

There’s no sign-up page.  
No “create an account.”  
Instead, you’ll get something symbolic: **an Elder Key**.

This is your token.  
Your pass.  
Not just for access—but for _intent_.

This space works because we know who’s here.  
We keep it small, kind, and warm.

There’s light here. But it’s a fire we tend together.

**Next: [[🍃The Whisper Grove]]
Where the conversation flows. Private, soft-spoken, and human.
