Title: The Way of the Essentialist
date: 2024-12-10
---

Mantra: Less, but better 
Mindset: It is about pausing constantly to ask: "Am I investing in the right activity?"
Rejects: The idea we can fit all in
To reach it: Distinguish the vital few from the trivial many, eliminate the non-essentials and then removing obstacles so the essential things have a clear, smooth passage

             If you don't prioritize 
                   your life
             someone else will
             
-------

Why should we design our life? 
    Because when we don't purposefully and deliberately choose where to focus our energies and time, other people will choose for us, and before long we'll have lose sight of everything that is meaningful and important 
    
How to achieve this lifestyle?
1. Explore and evaluate 
     Ask yourself: "Will this activity or effort make the highest possible contribution towards my goals "
 2. Eliminate 
 3. Execute

# Choice:
We often think of choice as a thing. But choice is not a thing. Our options may be things, but choice is an action. It is not just something we have, but something we do

The Essentialist knows that when we surrender our right to choose, we give others not just the power, but also the explicit permission to choose for us

              Do we take time to
                Stand still
                   And
              Take a break?

# Trade-offs
"We can try to avoid ro reality of trade-offs, but we can't escape them"
Essentials ask the tougher, but ultimately more liberating question: "What problem do I want?" An Essentialist makes trade-offs deliberately

# Escape 
We need space to escape in order to discern the essential few from the trivial many 

Set away time deliberately aside for distraction free thinking in a distraction free space. Doing absolutely nothing than thinking?

Why? Because by our abolishing any chance of being forced, we have also lost the time we have to think and process 

Also create space to read. You can do this by simply reading something from classic literature for the first twenty minutes of the day

It is important to make space to escape in your life

# Play
Embrace the Wisdom of Your Inner Child. Imagination is the source of every form of human achievement. Play, which I would define as anything we do simply for the joy of doing, rather than means to an end. Nothing fires up the brain like play.

Why? Because:
1. Plat broadens the range of options available to us
2. Play is an antidote to stress
3. Play has a positive effect on the executive function of the brain

# Sleep
After sleep when we wake up, our brains may have make new neural connections, thereby opening up a broader range of solutions to problems, literally overnight 

# Select
To become more selective in the choices we make, the key is to put the decision to an extreme test: if we feel total and utter conviction to do something, then we say yes.
