Mantra: Less, but better 
Mindset: It is about pausing constantly to ask: "Am I investing in the right activity?"
Rejects: The idea we can fit all in
To reach it: Distinguish the vital few from the trivial many, eliminate the non-essentials and then removing obstacles so the essential things have a clear, smooth passage

       If you don't prioritize               
       your life
       someone else will

Why should we design our life? 
    Because when we don't purposefully and deliberately choose where to focus our energies and time, other people will choose for us, and before long we'll have lose sight of everything that is meaningful and important 
    
How to achieve this lifestyle?
1. Explore and evaluate 
     Ask yourself: "Will this activity or effort make the highest possible contribution towards my goals "
 2. Eliminate 
 3. Execute

# Choice:
We often think of choice as a thing. But choice is not a thing. Our options may be things, but choice is an action. It is not just something we have, but something we do

The Essentialist knows that when we surrender our right to choose, we give others not just the power, but also the explicit permission to choose for us

     Do we take time to
     Stand still
     And
     Take a break?

# Trade-offs
"We can try to avoid ro reality of trade-offs, but we can't escape them"
Essentials ask the tougher, but ultimately more liberating question: "What problem do I want?" An Essentialist makes trade-offs deliberately

# Escape 
We need space to escape in order to discern the essential few from the trivial many 

Set away time deliberately aside for distraction free thinking in a distraction free space. Doing absolutely nothing than thinking?

Why? Because by our abolishing any chance of being forced, we have also lost the time we have to think and process 

Also create space to read. You can do this by simply reading something from classic literature for the first twenty minutes of the day

It is important to make space to escape in your life

# Play
Embrace the Wisdom of Your Inner Child. Imagination is the source of every form of human achievement. Play, which I would define as anything we do simply for the joy of doing, rather than means to an end. Nothing fires up the brain like play.

Why? Because:
1. Plat broadens the range of options available to us
2. Play is an antidote to stress
3. Play has a positive effect on the executive function of the brain

# Sleep
After sleep when we wake up, our brains may have make new neural connections, thereby opening up a broader range of solutions to problems, literally overnight 

# Select
To become more selective in the choices we make, the key is to put the decision to an extreme test: if we feel total and utter conviction to do something, then we say yes.

Use the 90% rule. As you evaluate an option, give the option a score between 0 and 100. If you rate it any lower than 90, change the rating to 0 and simply reject it. 

The point is that the very act of applying selective criteria forces you to choose which perfect option to wait for.

If we say yes because it is an easy reward, we run the risk of having later to say no to a more meaningful one.

How to make a selection?
1. Write down the opportunity
2. Write down a list of three minimum criteria
3. Write down a list of three extreme criteria
4. Check if it passes the first set of criteria
5. If yes, check if it passes two of the extreme critera
6. 4 and 5 yes? Taken. No? Reject

# Dare

-----
	The right "no" spoke at the
	 right time
	 can change the course of history

---
As hard as it can be to say no to someone, failing to do so can cause us to miss out on something far more important

The reality is that either we can say no and regret it for a few minutes, or we can say no and regret it for a few minutes, or we can say yes and regret it for days, weeks, months or even years!

# Uncommit
Beware of the sunk-cost bias. That is the tendency to continue to invest time, money or energy into something we know is a losing proposition simply because we have sunk a cost that can't be recouped.

Beware of the Endowment Effect. That is our tendency to undervalue things that aren't ours and to overvalue thing, because we already own them.

When we get so emotionally hung up trying to force something that is not the right bit, we can often benefit from a sounding board.

Instead of trying to budget your time on the basis of existing commitments, assume that all bets are off, all previous commitments are gone. Then begin from scratch, asking which you would add today.

# Limit
---
	Boundaries are a little like
	the walls of a sandcastle.
	The second we let
	one fall over,
	the rest of them come crashing down.

---
You need to recognize that boundaries protect your time from being hijacked and free yourself from the burden of having to say no to things that father's others objectives instead of your own.

Remember: Their problem is not your problem!

When people make their problem our problem, we aren't helping them; we're enabling them. Once we take their problem for them, all we're doing is taking away their ability to solve it.

Make a list of your dealbreakers with requests or activities you simply refuse to say yes to unless they overlap with your own priorities or agenda. Or another quick test is to write down things that makes you feel even a twinge of resentment even if it is a small pinch. It is a clue for discovering your own hidden boundaries.

# Buffer
---
	Use the good good times
	to create a buffer for			
	the bad.

---
How to create a buffer?:
1. Use extreme preparation
2. Add 50% to your time estimate
3. Conduct scenario planning

# Subtract

The question is this: What is the "slowest hiker" in your life? Then focus on these constrains or obstacles and remove them. Use the steps:
1. Be clear about the essential intent. How will we know when we are done?
2. Identify the "slowest hiker"
3. Remove the obstacle

# Progress

Research has shown that all forms of human motivation the most effective one is progress.

---
	Done is better than perfect

-----

# Focus

Be in the now. Ask yourself what is most important this very second. If you're not sure, make a list of everything vying for your attention and cross off anything that is not important right now.

Get the future out of your head by writing in a journal the following: "Whay might you want to do someday as a result of today."

	The pause that refreshes

# Be

Which are you at your core: non-Essentialist or Essentialist?

Whatever decision or challenge or crossroads you face in your life, simply ask yourself, "What is essential?" Eliminate everything else.
