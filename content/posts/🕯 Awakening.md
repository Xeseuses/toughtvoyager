### Our online life is changing...

We are more and more spending time online. We hasn't a phone and a laptop and more devices these days? And there is so much to offer. But life online has changed. There is more noise. Less peace. More control. Less trust. Fewer real moments... 

And there is more about your devices than being a simple digital tool:
- Your phone seems to know what you said aloud.
- Ads follow you like shadows.
- Every app wants your email, your birthday, your face.

These devices give us so much for so less hassle. But we trade our convenience for something else, but no one tells us what. And somewhere, inside all this scrolling, t starts to feel like we’re being watched.  

Because we are.

When did this change? Why did this happen. Can we do something about it?

### What's Actually Happening

Instead of simply browsing online, your every moment is tracked:

- 🧠 Every click, pause, or scroll feeds invisible algorithms. Websites and apps track what you click, read, search, and say. They build detailed psychological profiles to predict (and shape) what you’ll do next.
- 🎯 Algorithms decide what you see — not to inform, but to keep you scrolling, buying, fearing, or reacting. [[🔍“Algorithms Aren’t Neutral”]]
- 👁 Big platforms track where you go, what you buy, what you feel.
- 🔍 Advertisers know more about you than most friends.
- 🧬 Data brokers sell profiles that include your mental health, income, and location history. Your face, fingerprints, and voice are increasingly used to log you in and log things _about_ you without consent.
- Your phone, smart home, fitness tracker, ID — all these data streams are merged by governments and corporations into vast dossiers.
- I go deeper into this, in this post: [[📸“What They Know About You”]]

And this is not just some rumors. It is said by British mathematician Clive Humby: Data is the new gold .[^1]  And that's not all:

- New laws (like the Digital Services Act in the EU) will soon pressure platforms to monitor everything you post  automatically, and silently. And governments can now force platforms to censor, track, and report you. [^2] [^3]
-  Palantir and similar firms work with states to centralize personal, financial, social, and even emotional data into predictive systems. And as said:
- Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are coming — allowing financial surveillance and control at the transaction level. [^4]
- 📦 You are not the customer. You are the product. And we pay with [[🛑“What If I Don’t Want to Be a Product?”]]: 
	- Our attention: turned into a product, sold to the highest 
	- Our relationships: nudged by invisible algorithms.
	- Our thoughts: shaped by what the feed decides we should see
	- Our privacy: traded away by default, buried in legal fog.

But here’s the good news:

You don’t have to live that way.  
There are trails away from the noise.  
Paths built by people—not platforms.  
Small, quiet, beautiful places.

This is the beginning of one.
