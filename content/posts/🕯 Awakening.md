### Why You Feel Uneasy — And Why You’re Not Alone

You’re not imagining it.  
Life online has changed.  
More noise. Less peace.  
More control. Less trust.  
More screens. Fewer real moments.

We trade convenience for something else—but no one tells us what.  
And somewhere in the scroll, it starts to feel like we’re being watched.  
Because we are.

### What's Actually Happening

- 🧠 Every click, pause, or scroll feeds invisible algorithms.
    
- 👁 Big platforms track where you go, what you buy, what you feel.
    
- 🔍 Advertisers know more about you than most friends.
    
- 🧬 Data brokers sell profiles that include your mental health, income, and location history.
    
- 🇪🇺 New laws (like the Digital Services Act) will soon pressure platforms to monitor everything you post — automatically, and silently.
    
- 📦 You are not the customer. You are the product.

But here’s the good news:

You don’t have to live that way.  
There are trails away from the noise.  
Paths built by people—not platforms.  
Small, quiet, beautiful places.

This is the beginning of one.
