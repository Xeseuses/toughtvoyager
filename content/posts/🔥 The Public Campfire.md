Not everything in the sovereign digital world has to be hidden or private. Sometimes, you may want to _be seen_ ‚Äî to share stories, photos, ideas, or simply exist online without feeding corporate algorithms.

That‚Äôs where the **Fediverse** comes in.

#### üåç What is it?

The **Fediverse** is a network of independently hosted platforms (like Mastodon, PeerTube, WriteFreely) that _talk to each other_. You can join any server, follow people across servers, and post without needing Big Tech.

It's like email ‚Äî your address works anywhere ‚Äî but for social media.

#### üîê Privacy? Sovereignty?

- You don‚Äôt need a Google or Meta account to use it.
    
- You choose the community (server) whose rules and vibe you prefer.
    
- Many servers respect privacy and minimal data logging.
    
- Some servers even allow anonymous or pseudonymous use.

#### üß≠ Getting Started

1. **Choose a platform:**
    
    - üêò [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) ‚Äì Twitter-like microblogging.
        
    - üìπ [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org) ‚Äì YouTube alternative.
        
    - üìù [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org) ‚Äì Minimalist blogging.
        
2. **Pick a home server:** Try ones that align with your values like [mastodon.nl](https://mastodon.nl) or social.librem.one.
    
3. **Optional:** Later, host your _own_ Fediverse instance or use a privacy-forward relay service like [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social) or [Misskey](https://misskey-hub.net).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The Fediverse is _not private by default_ ‚Äî it‚Äôs more about control, independence, and community. For full privacy, stick with Nostr, SimpleX, or mesh networks.
