### A Starter Pack for Going Deeper

Some of you will want to go further.  
Set up your own space. Join other gardens.  
Maybe help someone else along the path.

This kit gives you tools.

- A USB stick or download pack
    
- A printable zine
    
- A list of beginner tools
    
- A guide to inviting others
    
- A “start here” for growing your own private garden

You can use it now. Or later.  
But it’ll be here when you’re ready.

A reflection. Not a pitch. Why walk this path at all?
