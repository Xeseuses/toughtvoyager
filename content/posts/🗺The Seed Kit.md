## 🗺 The Seed Kit

_Start your own quiet corner. You don’t need permission._

---

### 🌱 What’s a Seed Kit?

Once you’ve wandered the trail for a bit, you might want to make your **own space** — a place friends can visit, talk, or build alongside you.

The Seed Kit gives you everything you need to do that.

It’s like being handed a lantern, a map, and a few tools — so you can light up a new place at the edge.

You don’t need to be a tech expert.  
You just need the _desire to grow something different._

---

### 🧰 What’s Inside?

Depending on what you choose, the kit might include:

- A USB drive or SD card with **pre-installed software**
    
- A printed **guidebook** with simple steps
    
- Your 🧙‍♂️ **Elder Key** to invite others
    
- A link to a **starter Git repository** (digital blueprint)
    
- A Nostr identity (already set up for you, if you want it)

Everything works offline or in low-connectivity setups.  
You can use an old laptop, a Raspberry Pi, or even a tiny box like the Beelink EQ12.

### 🌐 What You Can Host

With the kit, you can run:

- Your own **Whisper Grove relay** (invite-only chat space)
    
- A **personal garden** (like this one)
    
- A **BTC or Monero node** (optional but cool)
    
- A **Yggdrasil node**, so others can reach you
    
- A **file drop**, a wiki, or anything else you care about

You’re not running “a server.”  
You’re lighting a lantern.

---

### 🧭 How to Get One

- Some kits are shared in person (at meetups, through friends, or in the post)
    
- Some are downloadable and printable from inside Haven
    
- Some are passed down by Elders (that could be you someday)

No gatekeepers. No accounts.  
Just a quiet chain of trust.

### 🌿 Why This Matters

Each kit planted is a resistance to centralization.  
It’s one more point of resilience, one more hut off the grid.

You don’t need to wait for permission from a platform.  
You are the platform.
