        <p>Mantra: Less, but better
Mindset: It is about pausing constantly to ask: &ldquo;Am I investing in the right activity?&rdquo;
Rejects: The idea we can fit all in
To reach it: Distinguish the vital few from the trivial many, eliminate the non-essentials and then removing obstacles so the essential things have a clear, smooth passage</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>         If you don't prioritize 
               your life
         someone else will
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>Why should we design our life?
Because when we don&rsquo;t purposefully and deliberately choose where to focus our energies and time, other people will choose for us, and before long we&rsquo;ll have lose sight of everything that is meaningful and important</p>
<p>How to achieve this lifestyle?</p>
<ol>
<li>Explore and evaluate
Ask yourself: &ldquo;Will this activity or effort make the highest possible contribution towards my goals &quot;</li>
<li>Eliminate</li>
<li>Execute</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="choice">
  Choice:
  <a class="heading-link" href="#choice">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>We often think of choice as a thing. But choice is not a thing. Our options may be things, but choice is an action. It is not just something we have, but something we do</p>
<p>The Essentialist knows that when we surrender our right to choose, we give others not just the power, but also the explicit permission to choose for us</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>          Do we take time to
            Stand still
               And
          Take a break?
</code></pre>

<h1 id="trade-offs">
  Trade-offs
  <a class="heading-link" href="#trade-offs">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>&ldquo;We can try to avoid ro reality of trade-offs, but we can&rsquo;t escape them&rdquo;
Essentials ask the tougher, but ultimately more liberating question: &ldquo;What problem do I want?&rdquo; An Essentialist makes trade-offs deliberately</p>
<h1 id="escape">
  Escape
  <a class="heading-link" href="#escape">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>We need space to escape in order to discern the essential few from the trivial many</p>
<p>Set away time deliberately aside for distraction free thinking in a distraction free space. Doing absolutely nothing than thinking?</p>
<p>Why? Because by our abolishing any chance of being forced, we have also lost the time we have to think and process</p>
<p>Also create space to read. You can do this by simply reading something from classic literature for the first twenty minutes of the day</p>
<p>It is important to make space to escape in your life</p>
<h1 id="play">
  Play
  <a class="heading-link" href="#play">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>Embrace the Wisdom of Your Inner Child. Imagination is the source of every form of human achievement. Play, which I would define as anything we do simply for the joy of doing, rather than means to an end. Nothing fires up the brain like play.</p>
<p>Why? Because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plat broadens the range of options available to us</li>
<li>Play is an antidote to stress</li>
<li>Play has a positive effect on the executive function of the brain</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="sleep">
  Sleep
  <a class="heading-link" href="#sleep">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>After sleep when we wake up, our brains may have make new neural connections, thereby opening up a broader range of solutions to problems, literally overnight</p>
<h1 id="select">
  Select
  <a class="heading-link" href="#select">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>To become more selective in the choices we make, the key is to put the decision to an extreme test: if we feel total and utter conviction to do something, then we say yes.</p>
