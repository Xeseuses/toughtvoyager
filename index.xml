      <description>All good and well do you maybe think at this point after reading some of my ideas, but what is the way forward then? In this post I want to give a short manifesto for how I imagine the future to be.&#xA;Explanation in short Link to heading The future will be decentralized and sustainable where voluntary cooperation, market innovation and strong property rights foster community resilience without the need for (a) centralized authority.</description>

      <description>In this post I want to defend the position for an anarchy based society. In my opinion is the concept of the state an relic from the past and do we need to go to another form of living. In my post [[The Failure Of Modern Day Democracy]] I already have argued I donÂ´t believe in (modern day) democracy anymore. In this post I will lay out why no goverment/rule (anarchy) is the better option.</description>

      <description>In this post I want to explore the thought that modern day democracy has failed. I think modern day democracy doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a future. I will explain why and propose a new form of government that i think is the better option.&#xA;Why democracy doesn&amp;rsquo;t work in its current form Link to heading Most western countries have a democracy as government. The people choose who they want to represent them. This sounds good in practice, because if a lot of people vote who they want, the government will do anything that&amp;rsquo;s in the best interest of the people right?</description>
